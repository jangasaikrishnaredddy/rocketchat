Adds badges to the member list indicating user roles ( Admin, Owner, Leader) to enhance visibility into channel ownership and roles. This change helps regular users identify channel owners and leaders directly, reducing administrative intervention. Implemented using logic to fetch user roles and display them as badge in the UI.
